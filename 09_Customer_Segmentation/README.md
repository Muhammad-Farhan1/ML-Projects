# 🧠 Customer Segmentation — Machine Learning Project

A complete end-to-end Machine Learning project where I perform **customer segmentation** using clustering techniques. The goal is to identify different customer groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. This helps businesses improve marketing strategy, personalization, and decision-making.

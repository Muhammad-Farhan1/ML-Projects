# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting future stock prices using historical market data and machine learning techniques. The main objective is to analyze stock price patterns and build a predictive model that can estimate future closing prices based on past trends.

This notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of a real-world data science project, including data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

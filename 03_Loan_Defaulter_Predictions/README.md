# 💳 Loan Defaulter Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to default on a loan based on their financial and demographic information. This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data exploration to model evaluation — and highlights its real-world application in financial risk assessment.

## 📌 Project Overview

Financial institutions face significant losses due to loan defaults. This project aims to assist in early risk identification by building a classification model that predicts loan default probability, enabling smarter and data-driven lending decisions.

**Objective:**

* Predict whether a customer will default on a loan.
* Improve risk assessment and decision-making for financial institutions.

## 🛠️ Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration & Analysis

* Explored dataset to understand distribution and relationships between features.
* Visualized trends using graphs and statistical summaries.
* Identified important patterns affecting loan default behavior.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Handled missing values and inconsistent data.
* Removed or treated outliers.
* Encoded categorical variables.
* Scaled numerical features for better model performance.

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering

* Selected the most relevant features contributing to prediction accuracy.
* Reduced noise and irrelevant data for improved efficiency.

### 4️⃣ Model Building

* Implemented Machine Learning classification algorithms.
* Trained models on processed data.
* Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation

* Evaluated performance using:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-Score
  * Confusion Matrix

The final model demonstrates reliable performance in predicting loan default risk.
